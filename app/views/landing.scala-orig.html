	                	<div><b>Independent Development.</b></div>
	                	<div>These Terms do not impair Maya Tastebots right to develop, manufacture, purchase, use or market, directly or indirectly, alone or with others, products or services competitive with those offered by you.</div>
	                	<div><b>Confidential Information.</b></div>
	                	<div>Our communications to you may contain Maya Tastebots confidential information. If you receive any materials or communications that are clearly confidential or marked confidential, then you will not disclose the Maya Tastebots confidential information to any third party without Maya Tastebots's prior written consent.</div>
	                	<div><b>Notifications and Modification.</b></div>
	                	<div>Maya Tastebots may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Maya Tastebots in our sole discretion. Maya Tastebots reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users. Maya Tastebots is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Maya Tastebots may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the 'last modified' date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Maya Tastebots Content or Maya Tastebots Platform after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these Terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Maya Tastebots Content or Maya Tastebots Platform.</div>
	                	<div><b>HIPPA Compliance.</b></div>
	                	<div>You understand and agree that the Maya Tastebots Platform is not HIPPA compliant and such compliance is not expected to be included within the Services unless otherwise agreed in writing.</div>
	                	<div><b>Governing Law.</b></div>
	                	<div>These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in USA, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that USA, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</div>
	                	<div><h4><b>ARBITRATION</b></h4></div>
	                	<div>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM Maya Tastebots. For any dispute with Maya Tastebots, you agree to first contact us at legal@@Maya Tastebots.io and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Maya Tastebots has not been able to resolve a dispute after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, "Claims"), shall be referred to a panel of 3 Arbitrators in accordance with Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 or any statutory modifications or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The venue of such arbitration shall be at Mumbai and the award of the Arbitrator shall be binding on both the parties. If you are using the Maya Tastebots Content or Maya Tastebots Platform for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any Arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Maya Tastebots Content or Maya Tastebots Platform for non-commercial purposes: (i) Maya Tastebots may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from Maya Tastebots; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Maya Tastebots from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.</div>
	                	<div><b>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. </b></div>
	                	<div>WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE Maya Tastebots CONTENT OR Maya Tastebots PLATFORM FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Maya Tastebots ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</div>

You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Maya Tastebots Content and the Maya Tastebots Platform.</div>
	                	<div>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall constitute a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Maya Tastebots failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</div>
	                	<div>These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Maya Tastebots without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</div>
	                	<div>These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Maya Tastebots in connection with the Maya Tastebots Content or Maya Tastebots Platform, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Maya Tastebots concerning the Maya Tastebots Content and Maya Tastebots Platform.</div>
	                	<div>If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</div>

	                	<div>Maya is founded on the concept of trust and, as such, earning and keeping your trust are paramount to what we do. At Maya, we are fiercely protective of your personal information. In order to provide the Service, we need to collect both "Non-Personal Information" and "Personal Information."

Personal Information includes only your first name and email address, which you submit to us through the registration process on the Site, the Maya App or Maya Tastebot and which is not shared with any third parties. You may also, but are not required to, provide us with your gender when registering for the Site or the Maya App or Maya Tastebot.</div>
	                	<div><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY</b></div>
	                	<div>To activate and use the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your first name and email address. You can create a profile by registering directly through the Site, or by any social networking sites or other sites with which we may partner or by which we may provide registration opportunities. When you register, you will need to enter your first name and email address (which functions as your user ID) and create a password. You may also, but are not required to, provide us with your gender. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your first name, email address and gender (if provided) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</div>
	                	<div><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;TO USE THE SERVICE THEREAFTER, YOU DO NOT NEED TO SUBMIT FURTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></div>
	                	<div>In an effort to improve the quality of the Site, the Maya App, Maya Tastebot and the Service, we track non-personal information provided to us by your browser or mobile application when you view the Site use the Service. Methods may include, the website you may have come from (known as the "referring url"), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you.</div>
	                	<div><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;INFORMATION YOU GIVE US</b></div>
	                	<div>As part of the Service, you may have the ability to share any information or opinion that you may post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service or on the Site or the Maya App, or the Maya Tastebot, including by using the thumbs-ups and pins. We refer to this collectively as User Content. In posting User Content via the Service or on the Site or the Maya App or the Maya Tastebot, you agree not to provide Personal Information or confidential or sensitive information relating to, or controlled by third parties unless: (1) you have obtained any required permission to do so under applicable law and, (2) for Personal Information relating to someone other than you, you have informed the person whose data will be included that their Personal Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy and you have obtained their consent to this Privacy Policy. You must do this even if an inability to obtain permission means that you cannot submit your User Content or other information. By providing information to us, you represent and warrant that you have made all required disclosures and obtained all required permissions.</div>
	                	<div>We may highlight the User Content you submit via the Service or on the Site or the Maya App or the Maya Tastebot such as reviews, comments, or articles. In addition, if you register for the Service using a third party service provider (e.g. Facebook Connect), any user who is connected to you via such third party service provider (e.g. a user that is your "friend" on Facebook or "follows" you on Twitter) can view the User Content you may submit via the Service or on the Site or the Maya App or the Maya Tastebot. In addition, if you voluntarily send information to another user, including by emailing such user a link, that information can be viewed and possibly used by such user.</div>
	                	<div>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information or publish links in public areas of the Site or the Maya App or the Maya Tastebot, such as the user profile pages or forums, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address within these public areas that they do not wish to share. We are not responsible for Personal Information you choose to submit in these forums or pages.</div>
	                	<div><b>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;MINORS</b></div>

	                	<div><h4><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW WE USE INFORMATION</b></h4></div>
	                	<div><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></div>
	                	<div>We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. Vendors who are performing services for Maya, such as the servers for our email communications, will have temporary access to your email address strictly for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. The Personal Information you provide to us is ONLY used to help us communicate with you.</div>
	                	<div>With forethought, discretion, and respect for our users, we may use your email address to send you messages, including information about Maya and special offers. We may use your first name and gender (if provided) or refer to your User Content in such messages.</div>
	                	<div>You may register for the Service using third party service providers (e.g., Facebook Connect) ("Third Party Services"). By enabling such Third Party Services within the Service, you permit us to pass information to the third party service providers for this purpose. Please remember that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such Third Party Services. You should review the applicable terms and policies of Third Party Services, including privacy and data gathering practices. We shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Services or any other third party site or service that may be enabled within the Service.</div>
	                	<div><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></div>
	                	<div>In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us provide the Service, improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. We do this as part of providing the Service and for purposes of improving the Service. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners and other third parties at our discretion. In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be transferred but would continue to be protected under this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy. We also reserve the right to release account and other Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law, to respond to legal process, to make disclosures under programs intended to prevent potential crimes or investigate persons, enforce or apply agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Maya, our users, or others. We generally will retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information. You must keep your own, separate records.</div>
	                	<div><h4><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</b></h4></div>
	                	<div>Your privacy and trust are paramount to our success and fundamental to our business. We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your account safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them. We generally will not ask for passwords or the like in an email. You agree not to enter information on the Site or the Maya App or the Maya Tastebot if you (or anyone else whose information you enter) desire a higher level of security than we describe in this policy or if you have not obtained any appropriate consents. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encrypted login credentials, off-site data storage, tiered-security data models, and bank-level SSL encryption for site transactions. We also employ industry-accredited services to test our site daily, and we subscribe to anti-phishing services and fraud-detection services to further protect the Site and our Service. Although we strive to minimize the risk of an unlawful security breach of our system, like with all systems, these measures do not guarantee that your information will never be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</div>
	                	<div><h4><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</b></h4></div>
	                	<div>You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. If we send you a promotional communication, you can opt out of receiving further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. You can also let us know that you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us in the "Settings" section of the Site. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out in the Settings section of the Site, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.</div>
	                	<div><h4><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES OR SERVICES</b></h4></div>
	                	<div>As part of the Service, we may provide links or access to other websites or services. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or services or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site, the Maya App, Maya Tastebot and the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website or service accessed from our Site, the Maya App, Maya Tastebot or via our Service. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.</div>
	                	<div><h4><b>6.&nbgsp;&nbsp;CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</b></h4></div>
	                	<div>Maya reserves the right to change this policy and our Terms of Use at any time. We will notify you of significant changes to our Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
